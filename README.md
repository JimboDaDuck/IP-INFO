# WHAT IS IP-INFO?

IP-INFO is a tool to get data from an IP, it's a very simple user friendly tool made in [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/)

# WHAT DO YOU NEED?

**IP-INFO Requires:**

 1. [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 2. An [IP](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera-gx&q=IP&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) to get data from
 3. That's it!

# HOW IS IT USED?

 1. Download the files, of course you need the files to use it!
 2. Extract the downloaded files, IP-INFO comes in a [.zip](https://experience.dropbox.com/resources/what-is-a-zip-file) file, you can [extract](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/zip-and-unzip-files-8d28fa72-f2f9-712f-67df-f80cf89fd4e5) it by right clicking it.
 3.  Run setup.bat, [batch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file) is a file type that runs commands, this installs all extra required files using Python.
 4. Open main.py, after you complete step 3, IP-INFO will automatically open, after the first time you run it, you will only need to open *main*.py
 5. Enter an IP, you can use [your IP](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera-gx&q=MY%20IP&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) by searching "My IP" on Google, alternatively you can use a websites IP or someone else's IP
 6. Choose between Advanced mode and Simple mode, the difference between them is: simple is much more organized but gives you less information, advanced is much more complicated but more information, you can choose either by typing "Advanced" or "Simple" when the tool prompts you to.
 7. Enjoy, after its complete you can press enter to restart the tool or close the window.
